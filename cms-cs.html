        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>Cyber Mind Space is an educational platform focused on cybersecurity learning, articles, resources, and community engagement. I worked on this project as a Web Developer &amp; Technical Architect, responsible for designing and implementing the initial production-ready platform with strong emphasis on security, performance, and scalability within real-world constraints.</p>
        <p>This project was built under shared hosting and limited backend access, which required careful architectural decisions.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="scope">
        <h2>Project Scope (Defined &amp; Owned)</h2>
        <p>I clearly defined and owned the following scope:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Static + dynamic web platform using HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
          <li>Secure Firebase-based authentication</li>
          <li>Content-driven architecture for: Articles, Courses, Resources</li>
          <li>Client-friendly structure for future expansion</li>
          <li>Security-first thinking despite shared hosting limitations</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="responsibilities">
        <h2>What I Was Responsible For</h2>

        <h3>Architecture &amp; Tech Decisions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Designed the platform to work on shared hosting (Hostinger) without Node/Express servers</li>
          <li>Selected Firebase for: Authentication, Firestore (data storage), Storage (media)</li>
          <li>Designed separation between public content and authenticated user flows</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Authentication &amp; Security</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Implemented Firebase Authentication (Email/Password auth)</li>
          <li>Enforced email verification and session-based access control</li>
          <li>Protected sensitive pages using auth state checks and page-level access guards</li>
          <li>Implemented Firestore Security Rules with role-based write access and user-isolated data access</li>
          <li>Integrated Cloudflare for DNS, SSL, and basic DDoS/WAF protection</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Frontend Development</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Built pages using semantic HTML5, custom CSS (dark + cyber theme), and vanilla JavaScript</li>
          <li>Created reusable UI patterns: article layouts, course cards, feature sections</li>
          <li>Ensured responsive layout, SEO-friendly structure, and performance optimization</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Content Management (Custom Solution)</h3>
        <p>Designed a custom article creation system to allow admin-only article publishing. This PHP-based article generator dynamically injects content blocks (p, blockquote, tables, etc.) and structures articles so non-technical admins could publish content while keeping HTML consistent and secure.</p>

        <h3>Security Testing &amp; Mitigation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Reviewed third-party security reports and identified platform limitations under shared hosting</li>
          <li>Proposed a Zero-Trust architecture as a long-term solution</li>
          <li>Documented what client-side security can and cannot protect and why backend mediation is required for true content protection</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="out-of-scope">
        <h2>What Was Out of Scope (Intentionally)</h2>
        <p>To avoid confusion, the following were explicitly out of my responsibility:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>React / Next.js redesign done later by another developer</li>
          <li>Full backend with Node.js/Express on VPS (not available at that time)</li>
          <li>Secure paid video streaming (requires server-side tokenization)</li>
          <li>DRM-grade content protection (impossible on shared hosting)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These limitations were clearly communicated to the client.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="deliverables">
        <h2>What Was Delivered</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Fully functional production website</li>
          <li>Secure authentication system</li>
          <li>Article &amp; resource platform</li>
          <li>Admin-controlled content publishing workflow</li>
          <li>Cloudflare-protected deployment</li>
          <li>Scalable foundation ready for backend upgrade</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="takeaway">
        <h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
        <p>This project demonstrates my ability to work within real-world constraints, make correct architectural trade-offs, think like a security engineer (not just a frontend developer), and communicate limitations honestly while proposing future-proof solutions.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="future">
        <h2>Future-Ready Vision (Proposed by Me)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Migrating backend logic to Firebase Functions / VPS</li>
          <li>Using server-mediated APIs to hide credentials</li>
          <li>Token-based media access (signed URLs)</li>
          <li>Gradual transition to modern frameworks when time &amp; resources allow</li>
        </ul>
